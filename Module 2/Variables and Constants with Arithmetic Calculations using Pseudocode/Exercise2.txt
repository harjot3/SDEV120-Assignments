Module 2 Assignment - Variables and Constants with Arithmetic Calculations using Pseudocode
Pseudocode Module 2 - Exercise 2 - Harjot Singh

- I went to your office with you and talked to you about this assignment.
- You said to remind you that I've been emailing you since last week about this assignment
- in regards to grade deduction for late assignment.
- Thank you Professor E!!

Exercise 2
Using the hierarchy chart, design the logic for a program needed by Hometown Bank.
The program determines a monthly checking account fee.

Start
    Prompt user for account balance and assign that to variable (ex. accountBalance)
    Prompt user for num of times account was overdrawn and assign that to variable (ex. numOverDrawn)
    - make sure this is integer and cannot be below 0
    If num of times account was overdrawn == 0:
        - Exit the program and print "Thanks for using this program"
    Else,
    Assign a variable to store the fee (ex. overDrawnFee):
        - this will = (account balance * 0.01 - 5) * num of times account was overdrawn
    Decrease the account's balance
        - calculation:
            - account balance - over drawn fee
    Print fee (overDrawnFee)
    Print account balance (accountBalance)
    Print "Thanks for using this program"
End
