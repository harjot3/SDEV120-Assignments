Corrected Pseudocode:

start
   // Declarations
   num firstTest
   num secondTest
   num average
   num PASSING = 60

   // Main program logic
   output "Enter first score or 0 to quit "
   input firstTest  // Missing input statement for firstTest

   // Loop until firstTest equals 0
   while firstTest <> 0 do
      output "Enter second score "
      input secondTest

      // Calculate average (with correct parentheses for order of operations)
      average = (firstTest + secondTest) / 2

      // Output the average
      output "Average is ", average

      // Determine pass or fail
      if average >= PASSING then
         output "Pass"
      else
         output "Fail"
      endif

      // Prompt for next firstTest or to quit
      output "Enter first score or 0 to quit "
      input firstTest  // Added input to get the next score
   endwhile

   // End of the program
stop
