   num utilities
   num taxes
   num upkeep
   num total

   startUp()  // Call the startUp procedure

   // Loop until mortgagePayment equals 0
   while mortgagePayment <> 0 do
      mainLoop()  // Call the mainLoop procedure to calculate total
      startUp()  // Call startUp again to get the next mortgage payment
   endwhile

   finishUp()  // Call the finishUp procedure

stop

// Procedure to start the program and get the initial mortgage payment
