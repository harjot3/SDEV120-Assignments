Corrected Pseudocode:

start
   // Declarations
   string name
   num hours
   num rate
   num DEDUCTION = 45  // Fixed DEDUCTION type to num
   string EOFNAME = "ZZZ"  // End-of-file marker for name input
   num gross
   num net

   // Main logic
   output "Enter first name or ", EOFNAME, " to quit"
   input name

   // While name is not the EOF marker
   while name <> EOFNAME do
      // Collect hours and rate
      output "Enter hours worked for ", name
      input hours
      output "Enter hourly rate for ", name
      input rate

      // Calculate gross and net pay
      gross = hours * rate
      net = gross - DEDUCTION

      // Check if net pay is positive or negative
      if net > 0 then
         output "Net pay for ", name, " is ", net
      else
         output "Deductions not covered. Net is 0."
      endif

      // Prompt for next employee
      output "Enter next name or ", EOFNAME, " to quit"
      input name
   endwhile

   // End of the program
   output "End of job"
stop
